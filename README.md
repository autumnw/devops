===================================================
As a DEVOPS engineer, I need to do lots of repeated work
everyday, like install python+django on 5 servers. 
I started ask myself the question: after the first server
was built, second is easier, but still not fast enough.
The best way is: After first building, I should have a 100%
automated process (A.K.A script) to build the remainder servers.
I just need to start the script, then go away(Play 30 minutes 
pingpong). After relaxing, when I come back, those servers are
ready to use!!! -- This is the right life for a DEVOPS engineer. :-)

I realize: I should start my new lifestyle from this project!!!
